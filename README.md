AIS - "Alternative Injury System"

This revive system is mostly useful if you want to combine it with AI soldiers. Also it will work for SP missions. The goal is to bring more realism, possibilities and importance to the role of the medic's gameplay, without using a whole modification.

It is a scrip package for mission makers. It comes out with a documentation for mission builders and users as well. The download includes a demo mission, the documentation and the stand-alone script files.
