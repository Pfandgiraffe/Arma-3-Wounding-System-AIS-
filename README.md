AIS - "Alternative Injury System"

This revive system is mostly useful if you want to combine it with AI soldiers. Also it will work for SP missions. The goal is to bring more realism, possibilities and importance to the role of the medic's gameplay, without using a whole modification.

It is a scrip package for mission makers. It comes out with a documentation for mission builders and users as well. The download includes a demo mission, the documentation and the stand-alone script files.

Hints:
To test crerate a new mission in the editor of Arma 3 or create a new folder in .../mpmissions with something like A3_Wounding_System.Tanoa and place all files from the repo within. It is mandatory to use .Tanoa Island cause the template was build on Tanoa. You can create every template you want if you know how to handle the mission.sqm. You can also have a look on steam and subscribe to the Wounding System. (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=954149033)
